# Tadel 1.0 (Kanban Board To-do app)

**Requirement**: To create a front-end for a todo app using redux

**Challenge**: First time using redux, jump right into coding after only 2 days of learning

**Overcoming challenge**: Using a sample data as initial state. Once I input a sample data, I can view how the data is structured using the Redxu Devtool - [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd). With that understanding, calling up the data to view it on the front-end becomes easier.
